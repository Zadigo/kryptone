"""
An automater is a class that allows you to
automate certain sets of actions an a specific
page or multiple user selected pages.

The difference between an automater and a spider
is that the spider will crawl the whole website
regardless of the page.

    1. Define a start url from which the spider
       should start gathering additional urls to crawl
    
    2. Define a set of actions that the spider should do
       on each visited page. You can also define actions that
       will be executed just after the spider has visited a page
       for example clicking on button in a cookies modal

    3. Register you spider in SPIDERS and run python manage.py start
