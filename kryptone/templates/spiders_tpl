"""
This is the main module for creating
a spider that will crawl an entire website

    1. Define a start url from which the spider
       should begin gathering additional urls to crawl

       Or, optionally, load start urls in 
       MyFirstCrawler.Meta.start_urls through a list 
       of urls to visit
    
    2. Define a set of actions that the spider should execute
       on each page. You can also define actions that
       will be executed just after the spider has visited a page

    3. Run python manage.py start MyFirstCrawler
