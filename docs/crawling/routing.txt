Based on certain identified paths of a website, you might want to direct to a specific logic contained in a definition of the crawler. Using a `Router` allows these specific kinds of actions.

## Defining a Router

```python
from kryptone.base import SiteCrawler
from kryptone.routing import Router

class EcommerceCrawler(SiteCrawler):
    start_url = 'https://www.examplecom/'

    class Meta:
        router = Router([
            route('route1', regex=r'femme\_\d+$'),
            route('route2', regex=r'[a-z\-]+\_[A-Z\d+]+$')
        ])

    def route1(self, current_url, **kwargs):
        pass

    def route2(self, current_url, **kwargs):
        pass
```

Using the example above, we would like to route to a specific logic depending whether we are dealing with a products page or a product page. We can identify these routes either by using the `regex` or the `path` parameter depending on whether the url path is complex or not.
