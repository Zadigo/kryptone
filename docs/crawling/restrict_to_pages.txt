You can instruct the spider to only select URLs from specific sections of a webpage, defined by HTML tags specified using a CSS selector. This can be achieved using the restrict_search_to option in the spider's Meta settings.

```python
from kryptone.base import SiteCrawler

class MyScrapper(SiteCrawler):
    start_url = 'http://example.com'
    
    class Meta:
        restrict_search_to = [
            '[class="row products-list"]'
        ]

```

In this example, only URLs within HTML tags with the class row products-list will be considered by the spider.

__Note:__ If the specified section is not found on the page, the spider will default to gathering URLs from the entire page.
